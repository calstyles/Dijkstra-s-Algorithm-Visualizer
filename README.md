# Dijkstras-Algorithm-Visualizer
This project is an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm that uses a visualizer to display the shortest path. The algorithm is constructed using a graph data structure in Java and uses data from JSON files to implement this idea. The visualizer was constructed using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to allow the user to select the starting node, the destination node, and if it is Rush Hour. To start this project, add the json jar file to the build path and run the Tester class.
